 Hey there! I'm just a fella who makes stuff. Nothing really crazy here.
- I have a interest in art, music, graphic design, writing, and programming. I also have a love for films and games.
- I'm not particuarly the most talkative, I don't have any places I can name off the top of my head where you can reach me in full (mainly because although I want to show people my work, I'm a little paranoid) so your best chance of reaching me is through here. As well, I'm not too active here: I mainly just made this in case I'm stumped on something, I'll likely use this account for more in the future though.



That's the profile page, you can go home now.
